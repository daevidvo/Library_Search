## Description üìù

Library_Search is a simple application that uses the Google Books API to find and save books to your account.

It uses GraphQL alongside MongoDB and Mongoose to save, update, and read information about the user and their associated books.

The front end was made with React.js to handle client-side rendering along with stateful updates without having to refresh the page in its entirety.
